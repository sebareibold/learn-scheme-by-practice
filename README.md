# Practice on Scheme

This repository contains various exercises written in Scheme, completed as part of a university assignment for the **Declarative Languages** course. The goal is to learn the fundamentals of Scheme through hands-on practice.

## Requirements

To run the exercises, you need to install [DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org/), an IDE designed for the Racket and Scheme programming languages.

### How to Run the Exercises

1. Download and install **DrRacket** from the official website: [https://racket-lang.org/](https://racket-lang.org/)
2. Open **DrRacket**.
3. For each exercise:
   - Open the corresponding `.scm` file in DrRacket.
   - Make sure the language is set to **"Determine language from source"** or **"R5RS"** (depending on the syntax used).
   - Click the **Run** button (or press `Ctrl + R`) to execute the code.
